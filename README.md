Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview
This project involves performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival. The analysis utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize and interpret the data.

Objectives
Understand the structure and key features of the Titanic dataset.
Identify missing values and handle them appropriately.
Explore relationships between different variables and survival rates.
Visualize data distributions and correlations.
Summarize key findings and insights.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
Description: The dataset provides information on the passengers aboard the Titanic, including features like age, sex, passenger class, and survival status.

Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Analysis and Visualizations
The EDA includes:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values by imputing or removing them as necessary.
Univariate Analysis: Examining individual variables using histograms and boxplots.
Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between two variables, such as survival rate across different passenger classes.
Multivariate Analysis: Utilizing heatmaps and pair plots to understand correlations among multiple variables.
Observations: Detailed comments and interpretations accompanying each visualization.

Key Findings
Survival Rate: Higher survival rates were observed among females and passengers in first class.
Age Factor: Younger passengers had a slightly higher chance of survival.
Fare Influence: Passengers who paid higher fares tended to have better survival outcomes.
Embarkation Point: The port of embarkation had a noticeable impact on survival rates.

Summary:
Most passengers were in 3rd class.
Females had a higher survival rate than males.
Younger passengers had slightly better survival rates.
Passengers who paid higher fares had better chances of survival.
Missing data was mostly found in the "Age" and "Cabin" columns.
